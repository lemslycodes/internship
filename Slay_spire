Import pandas as pd 
Import json 
— r = read in python 
With open (/gamedata.json’, ‘r’ ) as file: 
Data = json.load(file) 

Df = pd.read_json(sgamedata.json’)
df.head() 

newData = []  
For row in data: 
newData.append(row[‘event’]) - removes event label 

df= pd.dataframe(new data) 
dr.sample(5) - a sample of data 

- Difference between methods and functions. 
df.to_csv(‘/gamedata.csv, index = False)
